It provides users with a secure and user-friendly interface to store, send, and receive digital assets, manage NFTs, and interact with decentralized applications (dApps). With features like network switching, secure private key management, and real-time blockchain interaction, Martian serves as a gateway for users to explore and participate in the next generation of decentralized ecosystems.
